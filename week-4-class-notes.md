# Week 4 Class Notes

## Web Site Design Research

In preparation for the upcoming responsive page layout lesson, please do the following research:

- Find three different web sites that you find particularly nice in terms of visual design.

Concentrate on beautiful page layout, typography, color, use of photos. Don't choose sites because of animation or video as that is not what we are studying now.

- Take a screen capture of the site at each of these three different sizes:

1. Mobile phone (300-400px wide)
2. Tablet (768-1500px)
3. Desktop (1920px or bigger)

If you notice anything noteworthy at bigger or smaller sizes, take a screen capture of that too.

We will use these images as demos for a group discussion.
