# Week 3 Class Notes

This week, we will enhance your first semester global project by adding responsive images to each page. We will do this for **mobile only**, as we have not yet touched up how to do responsive page layout.

## Outline of the Steps

1. Copy your first semester global project root folder to your second semester folder.
2. Take an inventory of the images you used last semester:
   1. Do they have good image quality?
   2. Do you still have the original (large size) image to be able to resize the image properly this semester?
3. Replace any images that don't pass points 2.1 and 2.2.
4. Swap the img tags for picture tags.
5. Test the pages to see if your images are now responsive.
6. Upload to the GWD server.
7. Test the site from the live server.
8. Submit the link via MIO.
