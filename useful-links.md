## GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop is a visual interface to [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), which is a version control software, and the code repositories (aka project folders) are hosted on the [GitHub web site](https://www.github.com). GitHub is now owned by Microsoft.

If you work in web design, you can easily work remotely—such as being a [digital nomad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad)—and collaborate with team members worldwide using Git, GitHub, GitLab... there are several sites that offers the same thing. All the Microsoft-haters left GitHub when it was bought out.

I will be using **GitHub Desktop** to share class notes and code. It is already installed in the GWD labs. Please install it on your home machine to always have access to the latest information.
